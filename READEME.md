# Topo-visualization

*current version 0.0.2*



## Introduction

This is a beta version of `Graph` or `Topology` visualization tools which can help you draw networks quickly. I promise that it is very easy to use so that I decide not to provide the manual book to you : )

Here is a shortcut of the framework:

## Functions

The current version is just the simplest tools with which you can add/delete nodes and add edges. What's more, the adjacency list will generate automatically.

In the future, some of the functions will be developed:

- Better user interface
- More basic settings
- **Basic graph algorithms visualization**
  - Shortest path: Dijkstra, Floyd
  - Minimum spanning tree: Prim, Kruskal
- Binary tree visualization



## Development Logs

- #### version 0.0.1

  2018-08: Basic drawing functions

- #### version 0.0.2 (the current version)

  2020-01: Provide more function for drawing graph:

  - Edges in the graph can be weighted.
  - Add the adjacency list modules. **(TO BE OPTIMIZATION)**
  - Make the interface more user-friendly.
